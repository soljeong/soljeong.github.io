## 코드 요청

Hello ChatGPT, I would like you to generate a Python script that performs the same functionality as a previous script I have. Here's what I need:


4. It should have functionality to load user and item features from separate CSV files, perform one-hot encoding on categorical variables, and concatenate them with other feature data.
5. There should be a custom PyTorch Dataset class that handles the loading of data and includes methods for negative sampling.
6. The script must include a DataLoader to batch and shuffle the dataset.
7. Define a PyTorch neural network model for a recommender system using embeddings and fully connected layers.
8. Initialize the model and optimizer, and set up a training loop that calculates binary cross-entropy loss and updates the model's weights.

Please organize the script into sections with comments explaining each part and any assumptions you make. Assume the CSV file paths are given and the file structures are known. Also, make sure to include the ability to adjust hyperparameters easily.
